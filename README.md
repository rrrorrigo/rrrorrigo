## Hey there!
I'm Rodrigo Briones, a self-taught back-end guy who loves to learn new technologies. Currently studying Machine learning at Holberton School, having graduated from the foundations program with my [ESPot](https://github.com/rrrorrigo/ESPot) final project, which included a presentation in English in front of renowned companies in Uruguay (See more [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgPNJjicRKI&t=908s))

Also, I'm passionate about problem solving, having experience in projects such as creating a smart pot or a support page for nutritionists to better track their patients, prioritizing efficiency and code quality.
